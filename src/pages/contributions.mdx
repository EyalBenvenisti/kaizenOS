When I was a teenager, I hacked the schoolâ€™s e-learning platform. After the police got involved, the agreement (with mom & the principal) for staying at school was to avoid hacking, so I started playing with HTML in Dreamweaver, and then the passion for digital designs came along. So today, guilt-free, I sin with [HAK5](https://shop.hak5.org/) products.

## History

**The Marketing and the Social Media Era**

In 2010 I dropped BS.c at the IDC and partnered with my mate, and together, we co-founded Vsense, a digital marketing agency. Vsense delivered awesome interactive websites and campaigns through social media and developed a wide range of Facebook tools. As a side business, we formed Sumo, a social media school for almost 300 students in over 18 classes, which sold to a competitor.

Vsense had an extensive portfolio among our leading client where, MSN, Google, Mini, Groupon, Magnolia, Backardy, and well-known retailing brands.

**In 2016, I left Vsense to focus digital products & product  marketing**

Since 2016 I have worked with remote teams as an independent contractor for short & long-term projects and developed remote work methodologies.

Since May 2020, I have performed as a BoT member and contributed to developing the Ubuntu Touch project - An open-source mobile operating system driven by a tech-savvy community.

## Covid-19: a life pivot
**Life is too short to live in one place.**
Thanks to the new era of remote work, my wife and I permanently relocated to the US and joined our extended family in Minnesota. Seeing it is an opportunity for our kids to enjoy better education and for us to experience a new culture.
