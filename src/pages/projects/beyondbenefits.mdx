<PageDescription>

Beyond Benefits was an early-day startup that aimed to empower employees in a corporate environment by providing a wide range of lifestyle activities and services, seeking to offer concierge and well-being services based on company, team, and individual preferences.

I joined the founding team as their first design team member to build and ship an evergreen product.

### The challange
My mission was to design a SaaS platform while researching the well-being industry. The goal was to make a hybrid tool that is not a vendor management system, not employee management, and not e-commerce. BB is designed to be an intermediate platform that integrates with the client’s Calander and Mail.

My approach was to create a holistic product narrative throughout the well-being corporate environment. Moreover, I was the company's ears and eyes, spending my days with clients.

### Conducted
*  Research (Market Analysis, User Interviews)
*  Information Architecture
*  Design (Sketch)
*  Prototype (React)
*  Presentation for a group of investors

# Well-being study
Entering my Zen mode, I dive deep into the meaning of well-being. In my study on well-being culture, I discovered the six keys of prosperity: Community, Purpose, Health, Relationship, Security, and Environment. As I continued my research I found it to be the right natural way to lay on the ‘Product Fundamentals.’

I used that as a meaningful approach to tell the product story better, and also used Simon Sinek's 'WHY' formula to encapsulate every potential feature to clear the product value proposition.

A statement of your value at work as much as it is the reason your friends love you. We don't have a professional WHY and a personal WHY. We are who we are, wherever we are. Your contribution is not a product or a service. It's the thing which surrounds everything you do— the decisions you make, the tasks you perform, the products you sell— aligns to bring about the impact you envision.

## Statement examples
1. ‍"Give your employees a pleasant moment."
1. "Host an enjoyable event that fits the team spirit."
1. "Arrange a fun activity that fits the company culture."

The process helped me tell a story and convince other stakeholders that these features align with the product vision.

**Few example:**

* "Relationship" can be sharing a ride or book group class.
* "Community" can be a way to engage with an employee's family and the company.
* "Purpose" is a volunteer program aligned with the company's values.
* "Health" suggests nutritionist, fitness, yoga, and flu shots
* "Security" can be a finance mentor or pension planner
* "Environment" offers 24/7 concierge services at the employee's doorstep

# User research
My user research started with clients. I had an opportunity to explore Amazon, WeWork, and Amdocs well-being programs, where I spent days making administrative decisions, planning and budgeting employee activities.

## My subjects were various associates in Amadocs, Amazon and WeWork
- Yakir is a community manager at WeWork. His top priority is to satisfy WeWork tenants.
- Dana is an HR manager at Amdocs, and her essential job is to keep track of employees and understand their physical and mental needs.
- Yael is a  Dev team leader at Amazon, and she is looking for ways to forge "team spirit."

### Field findings:
- Google spreadsheet was, in most cases the solution to sign employees to office concierge services.
- Managers required online advice on how to balance their wellness programs
- While we tested "Hairdresser on-demand" MVP at the WeWork office. 75% used it! (We tested a few MVPs)
- Managers seek to give personal empowerment awards based on employee preferences, not theirs.
- Every organization has a different platform that needs a custom integration.
- I couldn't find any useful KPI and metrics to measure success.
- Budget planning runs through email, just around a quarter review.
- The vendor onboarding process was time-consuming, carried with massive signups papers.

During the research, I had the opportunity to listen closely to fresh ideas from actual HRs and Managers. However, one request formed out of many meetings aligned with the product goals, clients' needs, and performance.

## One feature to rule them all
I planned a helpful tool that engages the customers with our service by helping admins and users get activities within the 'WHY' company statement at all levels.

This feature tracks groups and users to see if they're satisfied with the company's lifestyle and wellness programs. When a manager sets goals, he manages them, which eventually gets feedback from the employees.

The feature is controlled by the Admins but balanced with employees' feedback.

- #1 'Team manager' sets the feature with five developers, goals, and purposes. 'Beyond benefit' has a pretty extended recommendation to offer him based on pre-knowledge regarding the team size, position, and individual preferences.
- #2 CEO has over 40 employees on his workforce with a range of titles. Beyond benefits filters the right packages so he can choose and create a meaningful event based on the company values and goals.
Once an event ends, the team can provide feedback.

# Market Research
**What other companies doing to preserve employees?**
Some were service companies, and others developed a product. But, I noticed that everyone provides the basics to empower employees, but none has the right flow, decision driving process, and KPI that works.

E.g., In Google, every employee deserve 40 monthly hours to Volunteer/Learn something new or develop skills

Our product couldn't provide what the big corporate provide, but we can imitate humanistic approaches in the product design process.


## Off the shelves componenets

So to offer 'built-in experiences' as off the shelve features' to enhance the dynamics in the company - All automated without to request specific features.

This part was like playing with Lego bricks: gather useful components, then convert them into something original and new.

You might think that people have to come up with ground-breaking brilliant new ideas to solve the problems. However, when you look at any great innovation, it’s actually built on remixing and improving old ideas. We would gather solutions from other industries, other companies or old ideas that have been floating around in company for a while.

We came with a handful of internal activities that the company can have in- house to establish a culture around.

**Reading program**: automate enrollment of meeting once x time
**Bike-sharing**: automate guidelines on how and where to care bikes, location, place, rules
**Ride-sharing**: Integration with Waze expose employee's locations
