Ubuntu Touch is a mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system, developed & dropped by Canonical. Now developed by the UBports foundation.

My mission was to hack the growth potential in a FOSS-driven community. Connecting volunteers at the right time, right place.

# DeviceOps

## DeviceOps had a clear goal to track the progress of all current UT devices. Since Devices launched, it has become popular with newcomers and especially with Linux users waiting for their smartphone to appear on the list.

> Thanks to the many porters and members who check its accuracy, it has become UBportsâ€™ primary visual guide to what is available, a beautifully designed summary of what UBports has to offer.

Lately, the huge expansion of phone models brought about by a unified approach to dealing with Android 9 hardware fuelled demands from our community for more comprehensive information, organised in a useful way. This challenged us to undertake a new round of development to take it beyond a regular device resume site. As a result, Devices is having a much greater influence on user decisions. Of course the choices which users make have a major impact on the priorities and direction of UBports.


## Users journey

1. For porters it is a place to get known
2. For users it is a place to follow progress and track issues
3. For contributors it is a place to give back
4. For newcomers it is their place to find advice on which device to buy, before flashing a first phone with Ubuntu Touch

Porting is a journey not only for porters but also for the device owners who are following them. Connecting them together at every level is vital for our community.

Imagine porters working on a device, whether doing it solo or in a group. They are balancing a range of different activities. Up to the point where their device is added to the installer, their daily routine is to troubleshoot and to help prevent early adopters of the device bricking it in the process of building and testing.

Porters need to have a community of users around them to help solve issues, test features, or just to help each other so porters have time to concentrate on their work.

# Developer Portal

I designed & prototype a developer portal where all levels of volunteers and core developers can view, scan, and work together. This general Piller consolidates Github, and GitLab reposotiotires into one developer experience, which blends CI/CD pipelines, merge requests, and project information.
