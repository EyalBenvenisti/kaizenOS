1. **Ship quickly, urgency is important**

  I like to work fast and know user-centered design and development is an iterative process.

2. **Design is continuous**

  The design process doesn't stop when a visual design is finished or when a spec is defined. It's an ongoing process from conception to development, to post-ship research to continuous improvement.

3. **Don't be afraid to dig deep**.

  I start every project with the assumption that I know almost nothing about what makes it tick. I start with a blank slate and do my best to cast off assumptions and explore about all the different edges of the problem.

4. **Critique early, often, and with everyone.**

    Critique is the best way to learn, improve, and get to the best solutions. It should happen at every stage with folks from inside and outside of the design team.

5. **Design and build systems, not just features.**

  Everything should be part of a larger ecosystem. Consistent design, user experience, and engineering all benefit when we think in systems, rather than singular features.
