Up to the point where their device is added to the installer, their daily routine is to troubleshoot and to help prevent early adopters of the device bricking it in the process of building and testing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qdRq4jD.png)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R6PU8aL.png)\n\nPorters need to have a community of users around them to help solve issues, test features, or just to help each other so porters have time to concentrate on their work.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gFjX1Wb.jpg)\n\n\n# Developer Portal\n\nI designed & prototype a developer portal where all levels of volunteers and core developers can view, scan, and work together.
